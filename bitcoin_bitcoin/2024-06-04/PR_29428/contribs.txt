Notes:
- Commented:  > You'll have to remove the TODO on the top of the file as well, when the test was added?

Done. It'll be updated with my next push
- Commented:  > Are you still working on this?

I havenÂ´t been able to think of / work on other tests to add, but the current commit test is ready for review, so i am taking the PR out of Draft status.
- Commented:  Updated to remove a (no lonnger valid) TODO comment as requested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29428#issuecomment-1952480346. Also updated the PR title and description.
- Commented:  > Please delete the hidden comment in the pull description, because this will end up in the merge commit.

Oh, sorry for that. Deleted.
- Commented:  Updated to re add an incorrectly removed TODO comment.
- Commented:  > Needs rebase (for some reason Drahtbot isn't detecting this)
