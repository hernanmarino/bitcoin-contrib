Notes:
- Commented:  Are you sure you are not trying to run the 64 bit version of Bitcoin Core on a 32 bit Windows 10 ? This might be one of the explanations for that error. In any case, it looks like a windows error. Did you try downloading the binaries instead of compiling to see if it's not a compiling issue ?
