Notes:
- Commented:  This is a nice idea. I always have a conflict between submitting this simple typo-fixing PRs and ignoring them. This should be done often, for evey release .
> We probably don't want too many pull requests that just fix a typo. At the same time, if we never fix them people will start ignore the linter all-together. So my suggestion would be to do this before branch-off.
